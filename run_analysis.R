# Getting and Cleaning Data
# Course Project

# The function called run_analysis does the following. 
# 
# 1 Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
# 2 Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
# 3 Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
# 4 Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
# 5 Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
